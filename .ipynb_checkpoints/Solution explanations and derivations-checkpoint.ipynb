    "We can also see that we need $x^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{12}$ since $d(3s-1)$ is an integer, but this is automatically satisfied when $x \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we also need to check that $(x^2 - 1)/12$ can be written in the form $d(3s-1)$  (i.e. it can be factored into two positive integers $(n-m)$ and $(3(n+m)-1)$ for some integers $n>m>0$) and that the equation for $b$ also produces an integer (i.e. $\\sqrt{1 + 18(s^2 + n^2) - 12s} \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$). These are referred to as condition 1 and condition 2 in the code below, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to find the values of $a$ (and thus $D = \\dfrac{a(3a-1)}{2}$) which solve problem 44 in ascending order, we can iterate over integers $x \\equiv 5 \\pmod 6$ and calculate $D$ for any $x$ which satisfies the above conditions. The code below can be used to calculate the first $N$ such $D$."
